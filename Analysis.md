## 1. Introduction:
The Selenium web scraper is designed to extract information from cars24.com, a popular online used car platform. It focuses on retrieving key details about various types of used cars, 
including their model, distance traveled, year of purchase, previous owners, RTO location, transmission type, car type, fuel used, and price.

## 2. Features:
Scraping car data from cars24.com.Extracting details such as car name, distance, year bought, previous owners, RTO location, transmission, car type, fuel, and price.Handling various car 
types including sedans, SUVs, hatchbacks, luxury SUVs, and luxury sedans.

## 3. UML Diagrams:

Class Diagram: Represents the classes involved in the scraper, such as the main scraper class, page parser, and data model.
Sequence Diagram: Illustrates the flow of interactions between different components during the scraping process.

## 4. Analysis:

Analyzing the structure of cars24.com to identify HTML elements and patterns for data extraction.Evaluating potential challenges such as dynamic page loading or changes in website structure.

## 5. Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

Identifying the core domain entities, such as Car and ScrapingService.Defining value objects for properties like Distance, Year, Owners, etc.Focusing on the business logic of extracting and processing car 
information.

## 6. Metrics:

Monitoring the scraper's efficiency in terms of data extraction speed.Tracking the success rate of information retrieval from different car types.

## 7. Clean Code Development:

Adhering to naming conventions for clarity.Modularizing code into well-defined functions and classes.Documenting code to enhance readability and maintainability.Minimizing code duplication 
and promoting reusability.

## 8. Build:

Utilizing build tools like Maven or Gradle for dependency management.Ensuring a smooth and automated build process for the scraper.

## 9. Unit Tests:

Implementing unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.Covering edge cases and potential error scenarios.Achieving a high test coverage to ensure 
robustness.

## 10. IDE:

Choosing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code for efficient development. Leveraging IDE features for debugging and code navigation.

## 11. Functional Programming:

Applying functional programming principles where applicable.Utilizing functions as first-class citizens for better modularity. Embracing immutability and avoiding side effects
to enhance code reliability.
