### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # For Unix/Linux
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Open the `config.py` file and configure any necessary settings, such as model parameters or data sources.

### Training the Model (if applicable)

If your project involves training a machine learning model:

1. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This step may take some time depending on your dataset and model complexity.

### Running the Application

1. Execute the main script to run the car price prediction:

   ```bash
   python predict_price.py
   ```

   Follow any on-screen instructions or provide input as needed.

### Testing

1. Run unit tests (if available):

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```


```

Remember to adjust the instructions based on the specifics of your project, such as data sources, model training, and any additional steps required for running the car price prediction application.
